# Select Screen

A utility program so I can switch between screens easily.  
I'm using bspwm as my daily driver and on some of my laptops I wan't to change the resolution quite often. Other times I want to select which display I'm using.  

So instead of remembering and typing out a long command I decided to write this little piece of code to help me with it.

It's not pretty but so far it seems to do the job well.
